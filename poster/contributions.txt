nawtrey: 
	- Wrote code to generate benzene molecules given a position vector input
	- Wrote code that outputs all molecule data to Data.txt file (atom name, atom number, molecule number, mass, neighbors, etc)
	- Assisted in converting functions to SI units
	- Wrote dictionary that provides list of all neighbors for each atom in a single molecule
	- Assisted in writing function that can determine the neighbors of each atom in any molecule in system
	- Provided general debugging assistance for logic errors in integrator
	- Added Hank Hill to integrator.txt for giggles
	- Wrote code that outputs integrator time statistics to file 'integrator_data.txt'
	- Assisted in abstract writing and poster development

rsexton: 
	- Generalized code to generate and write an arbitrary number of benzene
	- Wrote code that reads Data.txt into the integrator script
	- Wrote code to parse neighbor types and calculate forces accordingly
	- Sped up code using scipy cdist and cutoffs for nonbonded interactions
	- Wrote code to calculate inter and intra-molecular forces
	- Wrote code to allow for command line input and only requiring to run one script
