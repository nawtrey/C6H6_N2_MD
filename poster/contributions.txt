All members strategized on project development together.

nawtrey: 
	- Wrote code to generate benzene molecules given a position vector input
	- Wrote code that outputs all molecule data to Data.txt file (atom name, atom number, molecule number, mass, neighbors, etc)
	- Assisted in converting functions to SI units
	- Wrote dictionary that provides list of all neighbors for each atom in a single molecule
	- Assisted in writing function that can determine the neighbors of each atom in any molecule in system
	- Provided general debugging assistance for logic errors in integrator
	- Added Hank Hill to integrator.txt for giggles
	- Wrote code that outputs integrator time statistics to file 'integrator_data.txt'
	- Assisted in abstract writing and poster development

jgens:
	- Wrote functions in functions.py
	- Contributed writing on abstract and poster 
	- Gave general debugging assistance in integrator.py
