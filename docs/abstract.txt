The goal of this project was to create molecular dynamics code that would simulate the interactions of benzene molecules via the velocity Verlet algorithm. The interactions were modeled using the Morse potential and a weighted Lennard-Jones potential that functioned based on neighboring particles internal to each molecule. For multiple benzene molecules, Lennard-Jones interactions were implemented to account for inter-molecular forces. To obtain a stable molecule in simulation, dihedral potentials were added between carbon atoms. Bond parameters for the Morse potential were obtained from existing force-fields and used in the intra-molecular force calculations. The bond parameter don't give correct forces to produce a stable molecule with the current implementation. Adjustments need to be made to the parameters to determine a combination that gives a stable molecule. In the future it is possible that adding more forces and correcting the current parameters will produce a stable simulation.
