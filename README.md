# Simulating Benzene in Vacuo #

This code uses Molecular Dynamics (MD) strategies to simulate benzene molecules in a vacuum. It started as a final project for the [Computational Methods of Physics](https://asu-compmethodsphysics-phy494.github.io/ASU-PHY494/overview/) course taught in the physics department at Arizona State University, where the original authors, Nikolaus Awtrey, Justin Gens, and Ricky Sexton, were able to view the generated trajectories using Visual Molecular Dynamics ([VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)). It has since had contributions made aimed at modeling Nitrogen in a vacuum to simplify the code in an attempt to develop a fully functioning model. The overarching goal is to create a model that will allow for the tuning of force field parameters by way of heat capacity to see which, if any parameters are consistent with experimental observations (for the given substance).
